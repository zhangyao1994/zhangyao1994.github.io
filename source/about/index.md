### About Yao

I am a **Ph.D. in [Biomedical Engineerring](https://www.bme.utexas.edu/)** working with [Dr. Mia Markey](https://www.bme.utexas.edu/people/faculty-directory/markey) and [Dr. James Tunnell](https://www.bme.utexas.edu/people/faculty-directory/tunnell) at [The University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/). My research focus is using machine learning and data analytics based on spectra and image data for cancer research.

I received my B.S. degree from the [Department of Biomedical Engineerring](http://bme.sjtu.edu.cn/En) at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU)](http://en.sjtu.edu.cn/) in 2015 with Outstanding Graduate Award. 

Also, I did two **data science** summer internships at [Dell](https://corporate.delltechnologies.com/en-us/about-us.htm) in 2018 and 2019, where I used data science methods to improve forecasting accuracy and my algorithms have been implemented on IT production environment, scheduled for weekly runs and results are in use for business.

I am passionate about using data science models to solve problems because I believe that data is the best evidence for any decision making. My interests include **translational research** and **driving business transformation through data analytics**. 
- For translational research, I am willing to use AI in healthcare to help patients and physicians make better medical decisions.
- For business problems, I also hope to help with better decision making.

##### Fun Facts: 
- I host [Austin AI Tech Talk Meetup monthly events](https://www.meetup.com/aittg-austin/).
- I am a **photographer** and am sometimes hired to take pictures for parties/weddings.
