Current skin cancer detection relies on dermatologists' visual assessment of moles directly or dermoscopically. Our goal is to show that our automated similarity assessment algorithm on dermoscopic images can perform as well as a dermatologist and could potentially serve as the foundation for computer-assisted dermatological applications, with an emphasis on facilitating the intra-patient evaluation. Given one target mole and two other moles from the same patient, our model determines which mole is more similar to the target mole.
