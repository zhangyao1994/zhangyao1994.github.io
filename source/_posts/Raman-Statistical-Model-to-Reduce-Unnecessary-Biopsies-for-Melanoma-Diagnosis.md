A key challenge in melanoma diagnosis is the large number of unnecessary biopsies on benign nevi, which require significant amounts of time and money. To reduce unnecessary biopsies while still accurately detecting melanoma lesions, we propose using Raman spectroscopy as a non-invasive, fast, and inexpensive method for generating a “second opinion” for lesions being considered for biopsy.
