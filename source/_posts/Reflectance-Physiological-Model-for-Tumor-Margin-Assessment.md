The standard-of-care for non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC), including basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), is surgical excision of the tumor. To ensure removal of the entire tumor and minimize removal of healthy tissue, a tool for quick discrimination between cancerous and normal skin is needed. We propose using diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) to assess tumor margins.
